Checks Google Music for Missing Songs

First project, so don't really know what I'm doing, and the code is not very optimized.

To use, open up the py file with text editor and add your Google username/password. On first run, create your database list. On subsequent run, skip the database list creation, or you'll overwrite the original database. The script when then find missing songs and added songs. Lastly, you can update the library at the end to include new songs added.
